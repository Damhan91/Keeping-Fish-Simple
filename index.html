        <h2>What you need to get started</h2>
        <p> When starting your fish keeping hobby, there are a few things to consider when beginning your journey. In
            this section we will go over what you need to start and some things you need to think about before making a
            purchase.</p>

    <section class="container-1">
        <div class="box-1">
            <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>      
            <div id="Location"></div>      
            <p>Picking a location for your aquarium is more important than you think. Try not to have it beside windows
                or heating or aircon vents. As this will cause algae blooms with the light and temperature fluctuations
                with the heat and aircon vents
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box-1">
            <h3>Cleaning/Maintence equipment</h3>
            <img src='../assets/images/cleaning kit.jpg' alt="aquarium cleaning equipment" class="box-1-image"> 
            <p>Having cleaning and Maintence equipment will make you job as a fish keeper much easier. We recommend
                having a gravel syphon, glass cleaner (sponge or magnetic), net and a algae remover.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box-1">
            <h3>Tank (bigger is better)</h3>
            <img src='../assets/images/tank.jpg' alt="Fish tank" class="box-1-image">
            <p>Despite what you might think, having a bigger aquarium is easier to care for than smaller one. The more
                volume of water you have, the easier it is to maintain and balance your aquarium environment. We
                recommend at least 20 gallons (75 litters)</p>

            <h3>Filter</h3>
            <img src='../assets/images/Filter.jpg' alt="aquarium filter" class="box-2-image"> 
            <p>The filter is an important part of keeping a healthy aquarium. This will help clean your water and filter
                out the fish waste and debris. We recommend either a hang on back filter or internal filter. Just make
                sure that whichever filter you choose that it is sufficient enough to deal with the volume of water you
                have in your aquarium.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box-2">
            <h3>Heater and Thermometer</h3>
            <img src='../assets/images/Heater.jpg' alt="aquarium heater" class="box-2-image"> 
            <p>Fish can't produce their own body heat, so it’s important to keep them at their ideal temperature with a
                heater. It’s also advise to have a thermometer, this will help you keep track on the temperature of the
                water.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box-2">
            <h3>Lighting</h3>
            <img src='../assets/images/lighting.jpg' alt="aquarium light" class="box-2-image"> 
            <p>If your aquarium comes with a built in light, that's great! Just remember to have your light on between
                8-12 hours per day. Once you get more comfortable with your aquarium, maybe think of upgrading your
                light. Now you can get lights with timers and adjustable lighting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box-2">
            <h3>Substrate</h3>
            <img src='../assets/images/tank-substrate.jpg' alt="aquarium substrate" class="box-2-image"> 
            <p>There are many types of aquarium substrates, from gravel and stones to sand. Having substrate is a great
                place for beneficial bacteria to live, it also makes you aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <h2>Nitrogen Cycle</h2>
        <p>The Nitrogen Cyccle is a very importnat part when starting your aquarium. The basics of the Nitrogen Cycle is
            the procees where the ammonia (which is extremely toxic to fish) produced from fish waste and uneaten food
            is broken dowen to Nitrite and further again to Nitrates (which is removed with water changes)</p>
            <img src='../assets/images/Nitogen cycle.png' alt="Nitogen cycle" class="box-2-image"> 
        <p>Pro tip, to test the water we recommend getting <a
                href="https://apifishcare.com/product/freshwater-master-test-kit">API Water Test Kit.</a>This will help
            you test the level of Ammonia, Nitrites and Nitrates in your aquarium water.</p>
