    <h1>What you need to get started</h1>
    <section>
        <p class="intro"> When starting your fish keeping hobby, there a few things to consider before buying a tank and
            adding a fish. In the section below, we wil go over some of the topics that you will need to consider before
            getting that first fish.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <div>
            <h3>Location, Location, Location</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/location.jpg' alt="Location of a fish tank in a hall" class="box-1-image">
            <p>Picking a location for your aquarium is more important than you think. Try not to have it beside windows
                or heating or aircon vents. As the constant light will cause algae blooms, and the fluctuations from the
                heating or air vents will stress out your fish.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Cleaning/Maintence equipment</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/cleaningkit.jpg' alt="Fish tank cleaning equipment" class="box-1-image">
            <p>Having cleaning and Maintence equipment will make you job as a fish keeper much easier. We recommend
                having a gravel syphon, glass cleaner (sponge or magnetic), net and a algae remover. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Water test Kit</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/Watertestkit.jpg' alt="API Water test kit" class="box-1-image">
            <p>A water test kit will help you test your water for traces of Ammonia, Nitres and Nitrates. These three
                elements can build up over time from fish waste and uneaten food and are very toxic to your fish. Having
                a water test kit will allow you to test your water on a regular basis and notify you when the levels
                are too high and a water change is needed. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Tank (bigger is better)</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/tank.jpg' alt="Fish tank" class="box-1-image">
            <p>Despite what you might think, having a bigger aquarium is easier to care for than smaller one. The more
                volume of water you have, the easier it is to maintain and balance your aquarium environment. We
                recommend at least 20 gallons (75 litters)</p>
        </div>

    <section class="container">
        <div>
            <h3>Filter</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/Filter.jpg' alt="aquarium filter" class="box-2-image">
            <p>The filter is an important part of keeping a healthy aquarium. This will help clean your water and filter
                out the fish waste and debris. We recommend either a hang on back filter or internal filter. Just make
                sure that whichever filter you choose that it is sufficient enough to deal with the volume of water you
                have in your aquarium.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Heater and Thermometer</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/Heater.jpg' alt="aquarium heater" class="box-2-image">
            <p>Fish can't produce their own body heat, so it’s important to keep them at their ideal temperature with a
                heater. It’s also advised to have a thermometer, this will help you keep track on the temperature of the
                water.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Lighting</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/lighting.jpg' alt="aquarium light" class="box-2-image">
            <p>If your aquarium comes with a built in light, that's great! Just remember to have your light on between
                8-12 hours per day. Once you get more comfortable with your aquarium, maybe think of upgrading your
                light. Now you can get lights with timers and adjustable lighting.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Substrate</h3>
            <img src='assets/images/tank-substrate.jpg' alt="aquarium substrate" class="box-2-image">
            <p>There are many types of aquarium substrates, from gravel and stones to sand. Having substrate is a great
                place for beneficial bacteria to live, it also makes you aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
