        <h2>What you need to get started</h2>
        <p>This section will have a small paragraph explaining what is needed.</p>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
            <p>Picking a location for your aquarium is more important than you think. Try not to have it beside windows or heating or aircon vents. As this will cause algae blooms with the light and temperature fluctuations with the heat and aircon vents</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Cleaning/Maintence equipment</h2>
            <p>Having cleaning and Maintence equipment will make you job as a fish keeper much easier. We recommend having a gravel syphon, glass cleaner (sponge or magnetic), net and a algae remover.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Tank (bigger is better)</h2>
            <p>Despite what you might think, having a bigger aquarium is easier to care for than smaller one. The more volume of water you have, the easier it is to maintain and balance your aquarium environment. We recommend at least 20 gallons (75 litters)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Filter</h2>
            <p>The filter is an important part of keeping a healthy aquarium. This will help clean your water and filter out the fish waste and debris. We recommend either a hang on back filter or internal filter. Just make sure that whichever filter you choose that it is sufficient enough to deal with the volume of water you have in your aquarium.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Heater and Thermometer</h2>
            <p>Fish can't produce their own body heat, so it’s important to keep them at their ideal temperature with a heater. It’s also advise to have a thermometer, this will help you keep track on the temperature of the water.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <p>If your aquarium comes with a built in light, that great! Just remember to have you light on between 8-12 hours per day. Once you get more comfortable with your aquarium, maybe think of upgrading your light. Now, you can get lights with timers and adjustable lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Substrate</h2>
            <p>There are many types of aquarium substrates, from gravel and stones to sand. Having substrate is a great place for beneficial bacteria to live, it also makes you aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
