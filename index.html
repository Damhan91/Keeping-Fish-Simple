        <h2>What you need to get started</h2>
        <p>This section will have a small paragraph explaining what is needed.</p>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Location, Location, Location</h2>
            <p>Picking a location for your aquarium is more important than you think. Try not to have it beside windows or heating or aircon vents. As this will cause algae blooms with the light and temperature fluctuations with the heat and aircon vents</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Cleaning/Maintence equipment</h2>
            <p>Having cleaning and Maintence equipment will make you job as a fish keeper much much easier. We recomend having a gravel syphon, glass cleaner (sponge or magentic), net and a algae remover.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Tank (bigger is better)</h2>
            <p>Despite what you might think, having a bigger aquarium is more easier to care for than smaller one. The more volume of water you have, the easier it is to maintain and balance your aquarium enviroment. We recomend at lwast 20 gallons (75 liters)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Filter</h2>
            <p>The filter is an important part of keeping a healty aquarium. This will help clean your water and filter out the fish waste and debris. We recomend either a hang on back filter or internal filter. Just make sure that which ever filter you choose that it is suffiecent enough to deal with the volume of water you have in your aquarium.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Heater and Thermometer</h2>
            <p>Fish can't produce their own body heat, so its important to keep them at their ideal temperature with a heater. Its also advise to have a thermometer, this will help you keep track on the temperature of the water.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Lighting</h2>
            <p>If your aquarium comes with an built in light, that great!. Just remeber to have you light on between 8-12 hours per day. Once you get more comfortable with your aquarium, maybe think of upgrading your light. Now, you can get lights with timers and adjustable lighting.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Substrate</h2>
            <p>There are many types of aquarium substrates, from gravel and stones to sand. Having substrate is a great place for benifical bacteria to live, it also makes you aquarium look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
